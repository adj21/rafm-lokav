#We built a bot who is supposed to be able to earn money by using the
#relative strength index (RSI) method.
#RSI is a momentum indicator that indicates if a cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold.
#We used the traditional 30% for the oversold signal for an uptrend and
#70% for the overbought signal.
#The bot buys if the rsi indicates that the currency is being oversold but sells if
#it indicates that the currency is being overbought.
